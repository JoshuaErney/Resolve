1. **Functionality and Integration***
    - How deeply do the Helpdesk Ticketing and Documentation features integrate? For instance, can a ticket be converted directly into documentation or linked to existing documentation?
	    - Answer: Yes, while both the Helpdesk Ticketing side of Resolve and the Documentation part are separated, they are also highly interconnected. I don't think the examples given would be an appropriate use of the interconnected-ness of them, but there might be other ways that would be helpful to people who use resolve. 
    - Are there any automation or AI-assisted features that assist users in creating, managing, or categorizing tickets/documentation?
	    - Answer: Yes, there would be an option to purchase an AI "add-on" that would enhance the systems ability to help organize and sort all the information. there might be other areas where it could also prove to be super helpful. I am just currently unaware of them.

1. **User Interface***
    - Given your focus on ease of information entry, what features have been incorporated to make the data input process smoother? (e.g., templates, drag and drop functionality, auto-suggestions, etc.)
	    - Answer: Templates would be helpful. drag and drop functionality, auto-suggestions are all great examples of features that would be included in the basic functionality of the software. I'd be open to more suggestions as well.
    - Are there any visualization tools, like charts or graphs, for tracking ticket statuses, user interactions, or documentation access?
	    - Answer: Yes, all of the above. I haven't fully defined the full scope of what type of info can be tracked or recorded in Resolve. 

1. **Collaboration**:
    - Can multiple users collaborate on a single ticket or piece of documentation in real-time?
	    - Answer: Multiple users can collaborate on the same documentation, but not on the same ticket. each ticket is locked down when a helpdesk agent is editing info. 
    - Are there any features like annotations, comments, or approval workflows?
	    - Answer: There could be, I have no made any plans yet for these though. 

1. **Customization**:
    - Can users customize their dashboard or interface to better suit their preferences or workflows?
	    - Answer: Yes, they will be able to customize their dashboards so that it better aligns with what they need to see at a glance. Admins can change the information available to the agents as well.
    - Are there themes or layouts that users can choose from?
	    - Answer: There will be a default theme that is applied. 

1. **Security**:
    - What measures have been put in place to ensure that user data, especially business documentation, remains secure?
	    - Answer: None currently, although Privacy and security will be and is a very high priority for Resolve. We want users to be able to trust the platform. 
    - Are there any features like two-factor authentication, role-based access, or data encryption?
	    - Answer: Any and all security features that help to protect user data and information will be added or used to ensure reliability and security. 

1. **Search and Organization**:
    - How does the search functionality work in Resolve? Can users search across both tickets and documentation? Are there filters or advanced search features?
	    - Answer: Yes Search will be able to bridge the gap between the documentation end of Resolve and the Ticketing part of resolve. you'll also be able to and filters to help narrow down your search. 
    - Are there organizational tools, like tags, folders, or categories, to help users keep their documentation and tickets structured?
	    - Answer: Yes all the above listed options and more will be included in Resolve to help structure documentation and tickets. I'll flesh out later the specific ways in which that will work. 

1. **Notifications and Alerts**:
    - How are users notified of updates or changes to tickets and documentation? Are there push notifications, email alerts, or an internal notification system within the platform?
	    - Answer: Primarily through push notifications, but the other listed ways would be available as well. 
    - Can users customize their notification preferences?
	    - Answer: Only Admins will be able to change the notification settings for agents. 

1. **Mobility**:
    - Since there might be an iOS app in the future, what functionalities would be available on mobile versus desktop? Would it be a trimmed-down version or offer full features?
	    - Answer: The plan would be a trimmed down version which would allow you to do some basic functionality stuff with the purpose of having a fully functioning app later on. 

1. **Support and Training**:
    - Are there any in-built tutorials, tool-tips, or a help section to guide new users or provide support for existing ones?
	    - Answer: Yes there would be a knowledge base included to help answer users questions.

	    - Answer:  yes, both of those will be available.
